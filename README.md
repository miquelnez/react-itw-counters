#Â React Counter exercice

There are 2 components in this application: Counter and App. The steps below will take you through modifying and adding components to change functionality and implementation:

- Fork this project in github, and create a new branch to deliver all the changes.
- Update the Counter component to take onIncrement and onDecrement callbacks and ensure they update the counter's values independently.
- Use propTypes on the components.
- Render a fourth Counter component and ensure it's value is updated independently from the others.
- Be sure that the `npm run lint` works. Do all the required changes withouth modifyng the rules file


**EXTRA**
- Separate every component on App.js in its own file. You can create a module for all the components counter related components.
- Create a Total component, which should be displayed after the Counter components and always display the running total of all the Counter values.
- Convert the data array to a json, and ask for it on the beggining of the App component. Be sure that your counters still working.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
